# GraphADT

A college project where students were to create a graph data type from scratch which includes pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm. The project initially provided a main which pre-listed all of the vertices and edges for a specific graph. To prevent uploading a solution to that same graph, I created a small and simple graph to test the class:

Dijkstra's algorithm was ran starting on Node 4. The console output of the program is provided below, and is also in the "Graph.h" file:

STARTING FROM 4  
1: 4 -> 3 -> 1     Distance: 4  
2: 4 -> 3 -> 2     Distance: 7  
3: 4 -> 3     Distance: 2  
4: 4     Distance: 0  
5: 4 -> 5     Distance: 3  
6: 4 -> 5 -> 6     Distance: 4  
7: 4 -> 3 -> 8 -> 7     Distance: 6  
8: 4 -> 3 -> 8     Distance: 5  
9: 4 -> 3 -> 8 -> 9     Distance: 7
