# GraphADT

A college project where students were to create a graph data type from scratch which includes pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm. The project initially provided a main which pre-listed all of the vertices and edges for a specific graph. To prevent uploading a solution to that same graph, I created a small and simple graph to test the class:
